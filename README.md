After having enabled the plugin inside Geany through Geany's plugin manager,
you'll need to setup a keybinding for triggering the Open File dialog. Go to
the preferences, and under the Keybindings tab set the Open File keybinding, e. g. <Primary><Shift>o.

Open plugin preferences and under Open File tab add the folders that you want to be able to open files from.

Using the plugin is simple. Press the keybinding that you selected and the dialog will be shown.
Start typing any part of the file name that you want and the list will be filtered, showing only those 
file names that matches. If the desired file is first in the list (at the top) you can just press enter 
to open it, if not use arrow down until it is selected and then press enter to activate it.
